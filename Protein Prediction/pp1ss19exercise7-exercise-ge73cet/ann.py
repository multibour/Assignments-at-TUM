            This class is a wrapper for an artifical neural network and all 
            required pre-processing steps. The preprocessing steps include:
                
                1. Store hyperparameters, s.a. number of epochs, learning rate, ...
                2. Retrieve one-hot-encoding for all letters in a given Alphabet
                3. Read in raw data from text file
                4. Encode inputs (one-hot-encoding) and outputs (class labels)
                6. Use 'SAME' padding to artifically add samples at the beginning
                    and the end of the sequence. This ensures that the residues
                    at the start and the end of the sequence can also be predicted
                    by a sliding window approach. Here, zero-padding is used.
                5. Create sliding window view for each residue. As the sequence
                    was already padded in the previous step, the number of residues
                    should not decrease when sliding the window over the sequence.
                6. Split the data set into a train set & a test set
                
            After the preprocessing, the network can be trained. This includes:
                
                - Randomly initialize weight matrices w1, w2. During this step 
                    the bias term has to be taken into account (constant=1)
                - Train for n Epochs by updating your weights after each protein.
                    During this step ONLY the training set is used..
                - The performance of your model is monitored by assessing its
                    performance on your test set. This allows you to check whether
                    your model still learns (train & test loss decrease) or
                    if your model starts to overfit (only train loss decreases).

        Calculate the softmax 'normalization' for raw prediction scores.
        'Normalization', because the raw prediction scores are transformed to
        a probability within [0,1]. Subtract a constant value of max(predictions)
        to the exponents to make the softmax calculation numerically stable.
        This constant factor does not affect our training progress as we 
        multiply with a constant factor (learning rate) anyway.
        inputs:
            self
            predictions: numpy array of predicted lables for a whole batch 
                            (here: protein)
        Output:
            Normalized predictions for one batch (protein) as numpy array

            Calculate the cross entropy loss for a given prediction (y_pred) and
            the corresponding true class label (y).
            Please understand that in the context of machine learning (when
            calculating error rates between 0 and 1), the cross_entropy loss
            is equal to the log loss. Also double check the information on the
            slides if necessary.
            Hint: When calculating the loss, think of the groundtruth labels in
                    y as an array of indices. Also think about a
                    possible simplification of the cross-entropy summation if 
                    one of the labels is always encoded via 0 (multiplication

            Output:
                loss: Difference between predicted and true class label.
                Again this is calculated for a whole batch (protein). However,
                the loss for all samples in a single batch is simply summed at 
                the end. The expected return value is hence a single scalar.

            Calculate the derivative of the cross entropy loss (or log loss)

            This gives you the gradient for changing your weigths.

            slides if necessary.
            
            Hint 1:
                Consider the batch size when returning the gradient of the loss by
                dividing the gradients by the number of samples in the batch.
            Hint 2:
                While calculating the derivative of cross entropy, 
                consider that you have to take the derivative of the softmax into 
                account as well. This allows to simplify the final expression.
            Hint3: 
                When calculating the delta, think of the groundtruth labels in
                y rather as a matrix with a one-hot encoding of the label 
                ([1, 0] or [0, 1]) than of an array. Also think about a
                possible simplification of the cross-entropy summation if 
                one of the labels is always encoded via 0 (multiplication w. 0).

            Output:
                gradient: The gradient for changing the weights. Again, remember
                that we are performing batch learning, meaning that we do not 
                update the weights after each sample separately but that we 
                accumulate the loss of multiple samples and update the weights 
                simultaneously after all samples in one batch are processed.
                Here, you should return a numpy array of shape 
                    ( length of the protein x 2)
                You can use the dot product to update weights simultaneously
                during backpropagation afterwards.

            Again, please remember that we are performing batch learning while
